Welcome to the "noteskin workshop" for the "Enchanted" noteskin! This is a fully customizable, remastered version of the Enchanted noteskin that come by default with ITGmania. This version has redone assets for holds, rolls, and explosions in 4x resolution compared to the original, and the explosions are now modeled in the shape of the arrows (previously they were imported from the "Metal" noteskin).

Also, the mine graphics have been redone with double the animation frames (16 up from 8) with the misaligned frames and frame clipping issues fixed.

The graphics for the arrows have not been changed, but now there are over 40 new variants of the arrows, featuring various color schemes used in other noteskins (examples include ITG Cel/Metal colors, Dev, DDR Note and a few others) as well as variations of those color schemes giving them different border options, or no border at all.

Holds (both inactive and active), rolls (both inactive and active), receptors, mines and hold explsoions are all able to be color customized.
