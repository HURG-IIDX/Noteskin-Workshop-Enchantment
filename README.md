Welcome to the "noteskin workshop" for the "Enchanted" noteskin! This is a fully customizable, remastered version of the Enchanted noteskin that comes by default with ITGmania. This version has redone assets for holds, rolls, and explosions in 4x resolution compared to the original, and the explosions are now modeled in the shape of the arrows (previously they were imported from the "Metal" noteskin).

The mine graphics have been redone with double the animation frames (16 up from 8) with the misaligned frames and frame clipping issues fixed.

Tap explosions (the color flashes on the receptor when arrows are hit) are available in several color set options including FA+, Waterfall, and even sets with the fantastic explosion colored to match the popular "Rainbowmatic" judgefont. Regular ITG is the default color set. Here is a preview of the "Rainbowmatic" color set as an example.

Previews of each color set for tap explosions can be found in the Previews>Tap Explosions folder

The graphics for the arrows have not been changed, but now there are over 40 new variants of the arrows, featuring various color schemes used in other noteskins (examples include ITG Cel/Metal colors, Dev, DDR Note, DDR Vivid, RGB, and a few others) as well as variations of those color schemes giving them different frame options, or no frame at all. 

There are animated GIF previews of every arrow variation on the Previews>Arrows folder. They are all read from top to bottom in the following note timings (using the default as an example). This animated GIF can also be found in the Previews>Arrows folder in this download for reference.

The previews of all of the available customization options, please check the "Previews" folder. The arrows and mine previews are presented in animated .GIF form to show the in game animations. All other previews are static images.

Instructions:

First extract the "Enchantment - Workshop" folder and place it in your Stepmania install in your noteskins>dance folder. This is the noteskin you will be using as a base for customization. Feel free to rename it as this will be something you can make your own!

In the "Customizations" folder you will find the files needed to change the colors of the different aspects of the noteskin. Each aspect has numerous color options. Within each color folder you will find the .PNG files needed to change the color of the noteskin aspect. Place those in your  "Enchantment - Workshop" (or whatever you renamed it to if you did) and replace the existing .PNG files.

For example, if you wanted purple active holds, you would go to the Customizations>Holds>Active>Purple folder, and drag those .PNG files into the noteskin's folder.

Please note that the customization files for this slightly differ in filename from the Enchantment noteskin includeed with ITGMania, so please use the one included in this download for your color customization needs.
